# keep-prompt
#
# jab extension to force the prompt to the bottom of the terminal window, and scroll
# all other output in the lines above it.  This prevents jabs and notifications from
# overwriting what you're typing.
#
# It also adds the current time to the end of all interjections.
#
# This extension relies on your terminal having the following termcap capabilities:
#
# sc = save cursor
# rc = restore cursor
# cs = set scrolling region
# sf = scroll down one line
# cm = cursor move
#
# to use it, just add the following to your .jabrc
#
# source 'keep-prompt'	# may need to add path
#

# Filter on all notifications
on :interject do |body|
  li = `tput li`.to_i		# number of terminal lines
  $stdout.flush			# so we don't mix jab's output and tput's
  system "tput sc && tput cs #{li-2} 0 && tput cm 0 #{li-2} && tput sf"
  "#{Time.now.strftime('%H:%M')}#{body.chomp}#{`tput cs #{li-1} 0 && tput rc`}"
end

# Filter on prompts
on :prompt do |prompt|
  li = `tput li`.to_i
  `tput cm 0 #{li-1}` + prompt	# move cursor to bottom
end
