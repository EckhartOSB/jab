# jab script for creating an external notification of new jabs
#
# the count of 'unread' jabs will be written to a file:
# ~/.jabs/new
#
# unread is defined as jabs that occurred since the last time
# the user entered a command.  Thus, pressing Enter in jab clears
# all 'unread'.
#
# an external program such as xmobar can then pick up the
# contents of ~/.jab/new.
#
# You can enable this script at all times by sourcing it in
# your .jabrc:
#
#   source "notify-new"	# may need to specify path
#
